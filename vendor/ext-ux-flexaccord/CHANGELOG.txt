V0.2
16-April-2014
 - fixed: fixed an issue where it would not be possible to set the initial height of a 
panel with "0", i.e. collapsed


V0.1.1
17-July-2009
 - enhancement: (Layout.js) layout now injects "_isDragged" property nto panels that are
currently being dragged; added "previousHeight" to cache the height after a resize occured,
to only process calculations when necessary in "onResize()"; added fix for IE7 to properly
size the dragged panel's ghost; "getHeaderHeight()" now accesses the panel's header property
directly; "adjustHeight()" no only expands a collapsed panel if it is not currently being
dragged; added override for "layout()" to properly fire the "afterlayout" event;
"beforeExpand()" now calls "layout()" instead of "adjustHeight()" directly, if needed;
"onCollapse()"/"setItemHeight()" now calls "layout()"
 - enhancement: (DropTarget.js) "notifyOver()" does only process its calculations if the
last possible drop pos differs from the current possible drop pos; removed unecessary call
to "adjustHeight()" in "notifyDrop()" if the drop target is the panel's original owner
container

11-July 2009
 - enhancement: enhanced drop behavior if the drop target is the same as the
drop source - the layout manager will not recalculate sizings then, since the
dropped panel is a child of this container already


V0.1
10-July 2009
 - fixed: fixed sizing issues when panels are hidden
 - fixed: fixed an issue with "expand" when the dragged panel should be reset
to its original position due to an invalid drop operation
 - enhancement: updated docs, minor code improvements, added build-tools

09-July 2009
 - fixed: panels within container would not be sized properly on inital rendering
 - fixed: panels within container that have toolbars would not be sized properly
due to some spill that happens when calculating header height
 - fixed: collapsed panels would not always resize properly when dragging SplitBar
