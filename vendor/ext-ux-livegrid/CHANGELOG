16-June-2008

- enhancements:
 - BufferedGridStore - added overrride of getAt() method to translate
the passed argument to the appropriate index in the model; updated sources to take
overriden method into account
 - added cfg option "scrollDelay" in BufferedGridView for buffering calls to onLiveScroll 
when scroll-event gets fired (thanks to Rich Waters)
 - BufferedStore: removed custom applySort() implementation due to changes in findInsertIndex
 - BufferedStore: changed findInsertIndex to use parent implementation first, then check 
return value and adjust the index if needed
 - BufferedStore/BufferedGridView: moved bufferRange-member to BufferedStore
 - BufferedStore: optimized insert() method in BufferedStore
 - allowed to add records at position "0" in grid (existing records get shifted down)
 
- fixes:
 - wrong calculation in BufferedGridView.onLiveScroll (based on lastScrollPosition and actual 
scrollPosition) caused the view sometimes to not re-render some rows
 - provided bug fix for "ensureVisible: returned x-coordinate does not take the x-position
of the gridpanel into account" (see http://extjs.com/forum/showthread.php?p=175331#post175331)
 - wrong calculation of last displayable row after removing a row caused selection-model
to get out of synch with the store's data
 - when adding a record to the store on the fly, the ensureVisible-method
would not work always corect afterwards
 - when adding records, a previously made selection would block selecting the
newly added record
 - skipped request for updateLiveRows in Ext.ux.grid.BufferedGridView.adjustVisibleRows
when number of total records in store is less than the number of visible rows
 - request for buffering data in Ext.ux.grid.BufferedGridView.updateLiveRows() did
not apply the property "lastOptions.params" to the params sent with the buffer-request
