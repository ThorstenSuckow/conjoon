==========
 - fixed: IE6 did not render the step-indicator images as expected, added style-rule in ext-ux-wiz.css (thanks to donssmith)
 - fixed: IE6 complained about multiple OR conditions in Ext.ux.Wiz.initComponent

==========
 - fixed: IE complained about semicolon in examples/SimpleWizard.html
 - fixed: removed "!important"-style-override in examples/SimpleWizard.html since IE doesn't like it
 - fixed: quoted "default" in Ext.ux.Wiz.loadMaskConfig since it's a keyword in IE
 - fixed: finish-event did not pass the expected arguments to its listeners
 - enhancement: data returned by Ext.ux.Wiz.getWizardData now indexed by the 
 id's of the specific cards they represent
