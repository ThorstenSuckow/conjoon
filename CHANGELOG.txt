2011-05-31 0.1.4RC2
===================
Notable changes:

[Email module - client]
 - fixed an issue where an email would not be properly referenced when
preview window was dragged & droppped into the content panel, then any
operation on this panel would have been invoked (reply, reply all, forward)
due to the fact that the EditorManager would only accept a record of type
EmailItemRecord for creating an editor instance, but not EmailRecord (closes #381)
(thanks to larissa84)

[Feeds module - backend]
 - fixed an issue where the "author" field of a feed entry would not be
stored properly in the database, thus, showing the value "Array" as the author
name: adjusted backend code to inspect the return value of "getAuthor()" of the
feed entry object and apply found values properly (closes #382)
(reported by e-mike)

[Twitter module - client]
 - fixed an issue where replies would not be linked properly due to wrong
data type for specific fields; changed those fields to type "string" to make
sure that containing ids can be rendered properly (closes #376)

[Workbench]
 - fixed an issue where the "startup" sound would not play as soon as
the workbench is in "ready" state, even if the registry tells that system
sounds are enabled: resolved by adding a "onload" listener to the
SystemSoundManager that would call attached listeners to tell that it's ready
to be used; previously it was assumed that the driver is ready to be used as
soon as the workbench is available (closes #379)

[General UI]
 - fixed an issue where some regions of a container would not be
clickable if it was masked previously by a feed/email preview, and this
preview would have been hidden using it's animation function: adjusted
callback so the anim element's container gets hidden, too (closes #378)

[Datastore - mysql]
 - fixed an issue where two different indexes would target the same
column: changed index "user_id" to operate on column "user_id" (closes #377)


2011-05-13 0.1.4RC1
===================
Notable changes:

[Twitter module - client]
 - changed ui of both Wizard/Options panel to consider Twitter's new oauth
authorization process

[Twitter module - backend]
 - changed backend implementation to use Twitter's Oauth process now. Changed
structure of datastorage accordingly so that no Twitter related passwords will
be stored there anymore
fixed a showstopper which would prevent a successful installation when
check for prerequisites fails and users would not be able to page through the
install process(reported by odomera)
 - fixed some issues related to deprecated parameters Zend Framework would
still use when communicating with the Twitter API (see ZF-9215)
 - fixed types of fields which would still be set to "int"/"float" whereas
"string" should be used now

[General backend]
 - fixed the override of Conjoon_Config_Array::_loadIniFile() which would
trigger a notice if E_STRICT error reporting is activated

[Vendor]
 - Updated Zend Framework to version 1.11.6


2010-04-08 0.1.3.2

2010-04-07 0.1.3.1
==================
Notable changes:

[Datastore - mysql]

================
Notable changes:

[Workbench]
 - enhanced "Help" menu, added dialogs for submitting suggestions/bug reports

[Datastore - mysql]
 - fixed an issue with datastructure for attachment table, since some
attachments could not be saved due to restrictions of content length for "BLOB"
fields - changed field "content" in "attachment" table from "BLOB" to "LONGBLOB"

[Email module - client]
 - added DownloadManager for queueing downloads in conjoon
 - revamped DefaultViewRenderer for displaying email messages to show a
resizable and scrollable attachment list

[Email module - backend]

permissions before sending an email message / item to the client

2010-03-29 0.1.2
================
Notable changes:

[install wizard]
 - fixed an issue related to creating directories during the installation
process on unix systems
 - fixed an issue where the "edition" configuration property would not be
properly re-used while updating conjoon; fixed an issue where "apache" would
not be properly recognized during install if the server would not expose its
version number
 - updated wording for the prerequisite check for proposing setting group/owner
of the install folder/parent folder of the installation
 - added check for moving files/folders within install dir to make sure
files/folders are accessible through the given permissions
 - user will now be forced to properly set file permissions of the "install"
and all its sub folders during install to prevent fail of copying/moving
folders

[cudgets library]
 - fixed an issue with the cudgets library that would attach a cache buster
manually to each url on Ext.Ajax' event "beforerequest", instead of using the
"disableCaching" option directly; this would urls cause to be generated with two
cache busters (closes #353)

[Feeds module - client]
 - removed a condition in FeedGrid.js that would check if a click in a cell
happened while holding down shift/ctrl key, which would prevent the Feed Preview
to properly hide any shown Feed Preview Window (closes #346)

[Email module - client]
 - fixed an issue where fragments of the
EmailPreview Window would remain once the window slides out of the view
(closes #347)
 - fixed an issue that would not abort pending requests when loading contents
into the Email Editor if the corresponding panel was closed before the request
could finish, by adding an additional configuration option "requestId" to the
"formValues" object, which stores the id generated by the Ajax request.
"Ext.Ajax.abort()" will now be called with this id if necessary (closes #317)

[Email module - backend]
 - added method "getInboxFolderId()" to Email Module's FolderModel to return
the default inbox folder id; updated Letterman's "assignFolderId()" to use
this default value

[Ext.ux.Wiz]
- updated Ext.ux.Wiz to work with Ext 3.1.2 and removed dependencies for
Ext.ux.layout.CardLayout; fixed some minor issues that would not properly
check if values in a card are valid, thus allowing to switch cards even if that
shouldn't be allowed

[Vendor]
 - updated conjoon to use Ext 3.1.2, which fixes several minor ui issues and
provides minor usability improvements


2010-03-22 0.1.1
================
Notable changes:

[Ext.ux.Livegrid]

reported by hflipman (http://www.conjoon.org/forum/showthread.php?346) regarding
the loading of selections

[Reception module - client]
 - fixed a consequence of a possible race condition that could occur if a user
sets the workbench into "standby", then a login with the same user credentials
is done on another machine, and the previously locked workbench is unlocked
again

[General]
 - fixed several trailing comma issues that would prevent IE7 from starting
the application

[YoutubePlayer]
 - updated conjoon to use Ext.ux.YoutubePlayer 0.4 which fixes a few issues
and introduces functionality to chose from different video resolutions based
on the resolutions the currently playing video provides

[Feeds module - backend]
 - fixed an issue where item facade's "importAndAddFeedItems()" would not handle
an exception other than "Zend_Http_Client_Exception" properly, thus breaking
updating other feed items resources if any other exception was thrown

on the server during adding a feed (see #370)
