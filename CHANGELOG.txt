2010-03-29 0.1.2
================
Notable changes:

[install wizard]
 - fixed an issue related to creating directories during the installation
process on unix systems
 - fixed an issue where the "edition" configuration property would not be
properly re-used while updating conjoon; fixed an issue where "apache" would
not be properly recognized during install if the server would not expose its
version number
 - updated wording for the prerequisite check for proposing setting group/owner
of the install folder/parent folder of the installation
 - added check for moving files/folders within install dir to make sure
files/folders are accessible through the given permissions
 - user will now be forced to properly set file permissions of the "install"
and all its sub folders during install to prevent fail of copying/moving
folders

[cudgets library]
 - fixed an issue with the cudgets library that would attach a cache buster
manually to each url on Ext.Ajax' event "beforerequest", instead of using the
"disableCaching" option directly; this would urls cause to be generated with two
cache busters (closes #353)

[Feeds module - client]
 - removed a condition in FeedGrid.js that would check if a click in a cell
happened while holding down shift/ctrl key, which would prevent the Feed Preview
to properly hide any shown Feed Preview Window (closes #346)

[Email module - client]
 - fixed an issue where fragments of the
EmailPreview Window would remain once the window slides out of the view
(closes #347)
 - fixed an issue that would not abort pending requests when loading contents
into the Email Editor if the corresponding panel was closed before the request
could finish, by adding an additional configuration option "requestId" to the
"formValues" object, which stores the id generated by the Ajax request.
"Ext.Ajax.abort()" will now be called with this id if necessary (closes #317)

[Email module - backend]
 - added method "getInboxFolderId()" to Email Module's FolderModel to return
the default inbox folder id; updated Letterman's "assignFolderId()" to use
this default value

[Ext.ux.Wiz]
- updated Ext.ux.Wiz to work with Ext 3.1.2 and removed dependencies for
Ext.ux.layout.CardLayout; fixed some minor issues that would not properly
check if values in a card are valid, thus allowing to switch cards even if that
shouldn't be allowed

[Vendor]
 - updated conjoon to use Ext 3.1.2, which fixes several minor ui issues and
provides minor usability improvements


2010-03-22 0.1.1
================
Notable changes:

[Ext.ux.Livegrid]
 - brought Ext.ux.Livegrid 0.4.1 into the main dev branch which fixes an issue
reported by hflipman (http://www.conjoon.org/forum/showthread.php?346) regarding
the loading of selections

[Reception module - client]
 - fixed a consequence of a possible race condition that could occur if a user
sets the workbench into "standby", then a login with the same user credentials
is done on another machine, and the previously locked workbench is unlocked
again

[General]
 - fixed several trailing comma issues that would prevent IE7 from starting
the application

[YoutubePlayer]
 - updated conjoon to use Ext.ux.YoutubePlayer 0.4 which fixes a few issues
and introduces functionality to chose from different video resolutions based
on the resolutions the currently playing video provides

[Feeds module - backend]
 - fixed an issue where item facade's "importAndAddFeedItems()" would not handle
an exception other than "Zend_Http_Client_Exception" properly, thus breaking
updating other feed items resources if any other exception was thrown

==============


2010-01-21 0.1RC3

Tweets yet would trigger an error

[General UI]
 - removed debug code that would trigger an error in other browsers than FF

deactivating this panel (closes #369)

[Security]
 - fixed a possible security hole that could occur if relative links are used
in feed items (closes #371)

[Feeds module - backend]
 - fixed an issue that would break importing/adding feeds when a call to
"getLastDateModified()" from Zend_Feed_Reader on the specific resource would
return NULL (closes #370)

[Feeds module - client]
 - fixed an issue where the dialog would not be closable after an error occured
on the server during adding a feed (see #370)
