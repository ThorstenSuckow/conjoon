manually to each url on Ext.Ajax' event "beforerequest", instead of using the
"disableCaching" option directly; this would urls cause to be generated with two
cache busters (closes #353)

EmailPreview Window would remain once the window slides out of the view
(closes #347)

shouldn't be allowed

provides minor usability improvements

on the resolutions the currently playing video provides
