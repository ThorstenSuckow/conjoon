/**
 * iconv* is used internally by Zend_Mail for decoding, such as decoding header-parts
 * which are available in a format compliant to RFC2047 (@link http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2047).
 *
 * There might be cases when a mail does submit the encoded headers lowercased, i.e.
 * instead of upper-case literals for hexadecimal values, they are lowercased.
 * iconv_mime_decode_mimeheader can for example not decode he following string:
 * =?UTF-8?Q?Ihr_pers=c3=b6nlicher_Newsletter_vom_19.05.2008?=
 * since the hexadecimal values are lower- instead of uppercased.
 * This filter replaces all ocuurences from =a[...]..=f[...] with their uppercase
 * representative.
 * Some mail clients might also break the line right in a decoded char, e.g.
 * "=?UTF-8?Q?[0000741]:_TICKET_-_l=C3=A4sst_sich_im_IE_7.0_nicht_=C3?=\r\n=?UTF-8?Q?=B6ffnen?="
 * Notice the line break right in "=C3\r\n?UTF-8?Q?=B6", which is not allowed
 * since its a decoded german umlaut ("รถ"). The filter will also take this disallowed
 * breaks into account and tries to fix them.
 * It will also take header values into account which are separated by white spaces.
