Development notes:
==================
"config.ini.default.php" is the template for the configuration settings of the
application. Please adjust the settings in this file, the rename it to
"config.ini.php"; once this is done, add "config.ini" either to the ignore-list
of your SVN client or make sure you never commit this file directly to the
repository.
