NOTE:
=====
Call /install/index.php when installing or updating conjoon!


Manual installation notes:
==========================
Copy install/config.ini.php.template to /config.ini.php (this folder) and adjust the settings.
The same goes for the file install/htaccess.template, which has to be renamed to /.htaccess
(this folder).
Once done with installation, remove the entire "install" folder out of this directory.


Development notes:
==================
"config.ini.php.template" in the folder /install is the template for the configuration
settings of the application. Please adjust the settings in this file, then move it to
it to /config.ini.php (this folder). Once this is done, add "config.ini.php" either to the
ignore-list of your SVN client or make sure you never commit this file directly to the
repository. The same goes for the file install/htaccess.template. Adjust the RewriteBase value,
then move the file to /.htaccess (this folder).
