NOTE:
=====
Call /install/index.php when installing or updating conjoon!

Please refer to the INSTALL.txt file that comes with conjoon. If that file is not
available, you are most likely working with the "build" - all set and ready to install.
You should find the folder "install" within the folder this file resists in. Open
your webbrowser and navigate to install/index.php.
Follow the instructions that appear on the screen.
