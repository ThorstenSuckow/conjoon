Development notes:
==================
"config.ini.default" is the template for the configuration settings of the
application. Please copy and rename the file to "config.ini" and place it
in this folder; once this is done, add "config.ini" either to the ignore-list 
of your SVN client or make sure you never commit this file directly to the
repository.
