This folder contains scripts for building deployable versions of the intrabuild
project.

csscompressor.php
=================
cli script for compressing all css files used by intrabuild (except for vendor
css files) into one file named "intrabuild-all.css". All paths used by the script
depend on the directory layout as defined by the repository. Make sure you run
this script out of its current folder.
Note:
csscompressor should not be longer used since 0.1a2 in favor of using the build_css.xml
buildfile.
