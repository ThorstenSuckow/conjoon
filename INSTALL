Chapter 2. Installation

   Since V0.1a3, conjoon gets shipped with an installation wizard that makes
   installing and updating the application easier.
   Simply set up your Webserver so you can access the contents of /build/htdocs
   in your webbrowser and open the /htdocs/install/index.php. For further explanation,
   go to "2.2 Automatic installation"

Chapter 2.1 Manual installation
Folders
   When unpacking conjoon, you will find the following directory layout:
      + build
      + build-tools
      + src
      + vendor
   (Note: Depending on the package you've downloaded, the only the "build" folder
   may be available)

   The folder of interest is the "build" folder: You will find the
   deployable version of conjoon in there:
      + build
        \
         - htdocs
          \
           - install
           \
            - files
             \
              - datastore
              - conjoon_application
              - conjoon_libs

   The following steps describe the setup of conjoon.
      1. htdocs:
      ----------
         The htdocs folder holds all the files that should be accessible
         by your webserver. They can either be in the DocumentRoot of your
         webserver or in any subfolder of the document root.
      2. conjoon_application
      ----------------------
         The conjoon_application folder holds all templates and controllers used
         by the Zend Framework. It can be put into any location on your
         server, just make sure it is readable and writable by the webserver.
         Notice:
         Though the current version does not contain any sensitive data,
         the conjoon_application folder should not be made public accessible.
     3. conjoon_libs
     ---------------
         The conjoon_libs folder holds all php libraries needed by conjoon.
         It can be put into any location on your server, just make sure
         the php variable "include_path" points to it. You can also
         configure this using the configuration file of conjoon.
     4. datastore
     ------------
         This folder contains the files to setup your databse.

Installing the database
   The current version of conjoon only supports the MySQL database.
   Navigate to the folder /build/htdocs/install/datastore/mysql and open
   the file "conjoon.sql".
   Process the contents with your database. The current version does not
   support table prefixes, so you should install the tables into a fresh
   database to make sure you not accidently overwrite any existing table.
   Tables installed for the current version are as follows:
      groupware_contact_items
      groupware_contact_items_email
      groupware_contact_items_flags
      groupware_email_accounts
      groupware_email_folders
      groupware_email_folders_accounts
      groupware_email_items
      groupware_email_items_attachments
      groupware_email_items_flags
      groupware_email_items_inbox
      groupware_email_items_outbox
      groupware_email_items_references
      groupware_feeds_accounts
      groupware_feeds_items
      groupware_feeds_items_flags
      users

   Since V0.1a3, conjoon does not set up a default user. If you are not
   using the installation wizard, you need to add a user by hand.
   Do so by browsing the table "users" using phpmyadmin or any other MySQL
   administration tool and insert a new row. Make sure the password you provide
   is md5-hashed. Also, the "is_root" field for this user has to be set to "1".

Adjusting the configuration file
   Navigate to the path where you have copied the contents of the htdocs
   folder and rename the file "htdocs/install/config.ini.php.template" to
   "htdocs/config.ini.php".
   Adjust the settings to match your server setup. The file is commented
   so it should be quite easy to configure.

Adjusting the .htaccess file
   Navigate to the path where you have copied the contents of the htdocs
   folder and open the "htdocs/install/htaccess.template" file in a text editor
   of your choice.
   Set the "RewriteBase" value to the value of the "base_url" as configured
   in your "config.ini.php". This is to make sure mod_rewrite works properly
   if conjoon is installed in a subfolder of your document root. Once this is done,
   rename the file to "htdocs/.htaccess".

php.ini settings
   The following settings have to be adjusted:
       * magic_quotes_gpc has to be set to "off"
       * register_globals has to be set to "off"

   The include path does not have necessarily to be adjusted to hold the
   path to the "libs" folder, you can configure this using the config.ini.php.
   However, using the php.ini setting will give you a small performance increase,
   since conjoon does not have to set this value upon each and every request when
   configured in the config.ini.php.

Apache configuration
   Apache should be configured with
       AllowEncodedSlashes On
   This is to allow the redirector to use encoded slashes.
   See also http://zendframework.com/issues/browse/ZF-3959

   Notice:
   conjoon will still work if this setting is not adjusted, however, when
   redirecting to other URLS using links in RSS-feeds or emails, conjoon
   might throw an error.

Chapter 2.2 Automatic installation

Notes regarding updating conjoon 0.1a2
   Any version < than V0.1a3 is not compatible with the installation wizard introduced in
   V0.1a3. It is recommended that you set up a fresh install if you are currently using
   V0.1a2.

Notes regarding PHP's safe_mode
   The wizard will generate an error notice if it detects that PHP's safe_mode option is
   enabled. In this case, the wizard might not be able to move the conjoon_application/_libs
   folders to their desired location. If safe_mode is enabled on your webserver, you have
   to move the specified folders by hand, and set the file permissions according to your
   server setup.

Running the wizard
   Since V0.1a3, conjoon ships with an installation wizard that will make installing
   and further upgrading of conjoon easier.
   Simply set up your webserver so that you can access the contents of the build/htdocs directory
   using a webbrowser and call the index.php in the folder htdocs/install.
   The wizard will guide you through the setup steps, which should be quite easy to
   follow. Once the wizard finishes, you need to delete the install folder entirely.
   Otherwise conjoon will quit with an error message if it detects that this folder is
   still accessible.
   Note:
   The wizard will save the installation progress in a file called htdocs/installation.info.php.
   DO NOT DELETE THIS FILE! This file will help the wizard when you update conjoon in
   the future.
