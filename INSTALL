Chapter 2. Installation

Folders
   When unpacking conjoon, you will find the following directory layout:
      + build
      + build-tools
      + src
      + vendor

   The folder of interest is the "build" folder: You will find the
   deployable version of conjoon in there:
      + build
        \
         - datastore
         - htdocs
         - application
         - libs

   The following steps describe the setup of conjoon.
      1. htdocs:
      ----------
         The htdocs folder holds all the files that should be accessible
         by your webserver. They can either be in the DocumentRoot of your
         webserver or in any subfolder of the document root.
      2. application
      --------------
         The application folder holds all templates and controllers used
         by the Zend Framework. It can be put into any location on your
         server, just make sure it is readable and writable by the webserver.
         Notice:
         Though the current version does not contain any sensitive data,
         the application folder should not be made public accessible.
     3. libs
     -------
         The libs folder holds all php libraries needed by conjoon.
         It can be put into any location on your server, just make sure
         the php variable "include_path" points to it. You can also
         configure this using the configuration file of conjoon.
     4. datastore
     ------------
         This folder contains the files to setup your databse.

Installing the database
   The current version of conjoon only supports the MySQL database.
   Navigate to the folder /datastore/mysql and open the file "conjoon.sql".
   Process the contents with your database. The current version does not
   support table prefixes, so you should install the tables into a fresh
   database to make sure you not accidently overwrite any existing table.
   Tables installed for the current version are as follows:
      groupware_contact_items
      groupware_contact_items_email
      groupware_contact_items_flags
      groupware_email_accounts
      groupware_email_folders
      groupware_email_folders_accounts
      groupware_email_items
      groupware_email_items_attachments
      groupware_email_items_flags
      groupware_email_items_inbox
      groupware_email_items_outbox
      groupware_email_items_references
      groupware_feeds_accounts
      groupware_feeds_items
      groupware_feeds_items_flags
      users

   Once you have finished processing the file, you might want to change
   the username and the password of the default user. Do so by browsing
   the table "users" using phpmyadmin or any other MySQL administration
   tool and change the field "user_name" to anything of your like and
   the field "password". The value in the "password" field needs to be
   plain MD5 encoded.

   Notice:
   If you do not want to change the default user, the login credentials
   are as follows:
      Username: admin
      Password: password

Adjusting the configuration file
   Navigate to the path where you have copied the contents of the htdocs
   folder and rename the file "config.ini.default.php" to "config.ini.php".
   Adjust the settings to match your server setup. The file is commented
   so it should be quite easy to configure.

Adjusting the .htaccess file
   Navigate to the path where you have copied the contents of the htdocs
   folder and open the .htaccess file in a text editor of your choice.
   Set the "RewriteBase" value to the value of the "base_url" as configured
   in your "config.ini.php". This is to make sure mod_rewrite works properly
   if conjoon is installed in a subfolder of your document root.

php.ini settings
   The following settings have to be adjusted:
       * magic_quotes_gpc has to be set to "off"
       * register_globals has to be set to "off"

   The include path does not have necessarily to be adjusted to hold the
   path to the "libs" folder, you can configure this using the config.ini.php.
   However, using the php.ini setting will give you a small performance increase,
   since conjoon does not have to set this value upon each and every request when
   configured in the config.ini.php.

Apache configuration
   Apache should be configured with
       AllowEncodedSlashes On
   This is to allow the redirector to use encoded slashes.
   See also http://zendframework.com/issues/browse/ZF-3959

   Notice:
   conjoon will still work if this setting is not adjusted, however, when
   redirecting to other URLS using links in RSS-feeds or emails, conjoon
   might throw an error.
